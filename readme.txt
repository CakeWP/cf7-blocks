== Description ==

Web3 Token Gate is an innovative Web3 authentication plugin for WordPress. Web3 Token Gate allows users to show hidden content only to those that verify they own a specific Ethereum NFT in their cryptocurrency wallet. Web3 Token Gate authenticates the user and checks ownership of their crypto wallet. Use this plugin to create exclusive content for any Ethereum NFT collection.

Currently Web3 Token Gate works only with ERC 721 standard NFTs. Users must verify ownership using a [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) wallet.

Web3 Token Gate allows you to set two separate custom responses. Upon successful verification users will receive a message with the hidden content. If the users cannot verify ownership they will receive a second failed verification message.
